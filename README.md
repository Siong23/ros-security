# ü§ñ ROS-Guard: Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection for Autonomous Robots

ÔøΩ **ROS-Guard** is a research-driven project that develops a real-time, ML-powered **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** specifically designed for ROS-based autonomous navigation systems. It enables comprehensive cybersecurity protection through network traffic analysis, attack detection, and provides an open-source dataset collected from real robotic systems for the research community.

As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent across sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and smart infrastructure, cybersecurity is emerging as a critical concern. Robotic platforms, particularly those built on the **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, remain under-protected, exposing them to threats like unauthorized access, data tampering, and network-based attacks.

   ```

4. **Configure CICFlowMeter** (for feature extraction)
   ```bash
   # Follow the detailed installation guide: doc/README.md
   sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk maven unzip libpcap0.8 libpcap-dev
   git clone https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter.git
   ```

### Quick Start

1. **Set Up Robot Navigation**
   ```bash
   # Export TurtleBot3 model
   export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
   
   # Launch navigation stack
   roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch
   ```

2. **Capture Network Traffic**
   ```bash
   # Start packet capture (replace with your network interface)
   sudo tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -w robot_traffic.pcap
   ```

3. **Run Attack Simulations**
   ```bash
   # Example: DoS attack simulation
   python attack_scripts/dos_attack.py
   ```

4. **Extract Features and Run Model**
   ```bash
   # Feature extraction using CICFlowMeter (CLI method)
   sudo cicflowmeter -i wlp0s20f3 -c /home/jakelcj/output.csv
   
   # Verify the output CSV file
   head -n 5 /home/jakelcj/output.csv
   
   # Run prediction with trained model
   cd dataset
   python test.py
   ```
   
   > **IDS Operation**: The system runs CICFlowMeter through CLI to extract network features in real-time, then processes them through the trained ML models for intrusion detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the IDS Operates

The ROS-Guard IDS operates through a streamlined CLI-based workflow using CICFlowMeter for real-time network traffic analysis:

### Real-time Detection Process

1. **Network Traffic Capture**
   ```bash
   # Run CICFlowMeter through CLI to monitor network interface
   sudo cicflowmeter -i wlp0s20f3 -c /home/jakelcj/output.csv
   ```

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - CICFlowMeter extracts **76 network traffic features** in real-time
   - Features include flow duration, packet sizes, inter-arrival times, protocol flags
   
3. **Verification and Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Check the extracted features
   head -n 5 /home/jakelcj/output.csv
   ```

4. **ML-based Classification**
   - Processed features are fed into trained Random Forest model
   - Real-time anomaly detection with ~95% accuracy
   - Alerts generated for suspicious network behavior

### Command Reference
```bash
# General syntax
sudo cicflowmeter -i [interface] -c [directory/output.csv]

# Example with specific network interface
sudo cicflowmeter -i wlp0s20f3 -c /home/jakelcj/output.csv
```

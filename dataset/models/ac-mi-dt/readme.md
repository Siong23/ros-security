### Model Details:
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Feature Selection**: Mutual Information based selection
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Optuna-based tuning
- **Best Parameters**: 
  - max_depth: 14
  - min_samples_split: 2  
  - min_samples_leaf: 2
  - criterion: entropy

### Performance:
- **Research Accuracy**: High performance on training data
- **Use Case**: Feature importance analysis and interpretability studies

### Recommended Usage:
- **Research and Analysis**: Understanding decision boundaries and feature splits
- **Interpretability Studies**: Clear visualization of decision paths
- **Educational Purposes**: Demonstrating tree-based classification
- **Feature Analysis**: Understanding which features are most discriminative

### Comparison with Primary IDS Models:
- **vs AC-CNN-LSTM**: Simpler interpretable model but lacks sequence modeling capability
- **vs AC-CNN-MHA**: No attention mechanism or deep feature extraction
- **Interpretability**: Higher than deep learning models but lower real-world robustness

> **For Production Deployment**: Use AC-CNN-LSTM or AC-CNN-MHA models for better generalization and real-world performance.
